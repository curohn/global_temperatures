# Global Temperature - Linear Regression Example
This project demonstrates my skills in implementing linear regression models. Please note the predictions provided here are just for show, and should not be used for real-world applications.

## Tools Used:
- Pandas
- Sci-Kit Learn
- MatplotLib

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle, and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data). The dataset from Kaggle itself was gathered from the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study found [here](https://berkeleyearth.org/data/).
