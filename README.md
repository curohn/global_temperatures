# Global Temperature Linear Regression Example
This project takes a dataset of global temperature readings, and performs a linear regression on the data to predict future temperatures in the United States.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle, and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data). The dataset from Kaggle itself was gathered from the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study found [here](https://berkeleyearth.org/data/).
